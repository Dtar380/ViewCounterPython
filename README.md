## :clipboard: How to use

1. create a link using `https://viewcounterpython.onrender.com/user/repo` (you can create it without /repo if you want to see total viewcount through all repos of the user which have the API implemented)
2. add a query to customize your badge:
    - label=, by default Visitors,
    - labelColor=, by default C79600,
    - logo=, by default eye, (using octicons)
    - logoColor=, by default white,
    - color=, by default E1AD0E,
    - style=, by default for-the-badge
3. Your resulting link should look something like this:<br>
    `https://viewcounterpython.onrender.com/user/repo?label=views`
<br>

4. Add the link to a `![image](url)` markdown tag or a `<img src="url">` html tag
5. The result should look like this:<br>
<img alt="Visitors" title="Visitors" src="http://viewcounterpython.onrender.com/Dtar380/ViewCounterPython">
